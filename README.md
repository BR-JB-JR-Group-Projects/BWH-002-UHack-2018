# Conference Connect: An automatic event curator

## Motivation
* Connecting with people at events is a meaningful way to build a network.
* For a variety of reasons, these connections can be lost after then event.
* Maybe the participants aren't active on social media, or you forget their email.
* What we need is some way to integrate the experience of a conference with lasting outcomes.

## Goals
* Connect people at the time of meeting to maximise lasting connections.
* Enhance the experience of networking events by working with the hosts schedule.
* "Break the ice" between different groups at a conference, expanding the number of meetings.
* Advertise and emphasise the hosts core goals during the event, making events more effective.

## Implementation
* App that incorperates schedule and host information, curating the event in place of a printed schedule.
* Detects proximity of two users and suggests connections through linkedin, facebook, etc.
* Provides extra information to users about the goings on at an event.
* Allows the users to provide feedback to the presenters and hosts.

### Implementation aims
* Ensure connecting through the app feels natural, this is a key outcome for the app.
